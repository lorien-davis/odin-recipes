# Name

Brief description of what the application does/is.

## Features

So far the calculator only supports very basic sums, like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

#### Roadmap:

- Order of operations **_Including the use of brackets_**
- More complex operations _i.e cos, sin, tan_
- A delete button that only removes the last input

## How to use?
