        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Similar to the traditional flatbread, lefse is a thin flatbread made
          from potato. Lefse is usually served warm with butter and sugar. I
          like the sound of that! Lefse may take a couple of tries to perfect.
          The steps are simple, but it will take practice to get the dough just
          right for frying such thin pieces. It will be worth your effort,
          though, when you have warm and satisfying slices of lefse on your
          table.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 pounds Idaho russet potatoes, about 5 large potatoes</li>
          <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 cup flourâ€‹, plus more for dusting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Making the dough</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 175 F. Peel the potatoes, making sure that no
            peels or eyes remain. Coarsely chop them into 1-inch pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a stockpot, bring water to a boil and add the potatoes. Boil them
            until they are fork-tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drain the boiled potatoes well. Place them on a baking sheet lined
            with parchment paper and bring them into the hot oven for 15 minutes
            to dry them further.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the potatoes from the oven and pass them through a ricer. You
            need them to be finely riced, so twice through the ricer might give
            you a better texture. You should have at least 4 cups of riced
            potatoes.
          </li>
          <li>Mix in the heavy cream, butter, sugar, and salt.</li>
          <li>
            Mix well and place the potato dough in the refrigerator, covered, to
            chill overnight.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Shaping the lefse</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat a lefse griddle or your skillet of choice to 425 F. You need
            a very hot surface to properly cook the lefse. Use a pastry blender
            to cut the flour into the chilled potatoes, or vigorously knead the
            flour in until you have a smooth dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            With the help of an ice cream scoop, divide the dough into 16 to 20
            biscuit-sized balls.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generously flour a pastry cloth or board and a rolling pin. Roll out
            each piece of dough into a 12-inch circle, dusting with more flour
            as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carefully lift the circle with a lefse stick or the handle of a flat
            wooden spatula. Transfer it quickly to the griddle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the lefse on the griddle until brown spots begin to appear.
          </li>
          <li>Flip and cook the other side.</li>
          <li>
            Remove the cooked lefse to a plate lined with a damp clean cloth to
            cool. Cover with another damp cloth. Continue to cook the remaining
            dough balls until you've used all of the dough.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the lefse smeared with butter to taste and a sprinkle or two
            of sugar.
          </li>
        </ol>
