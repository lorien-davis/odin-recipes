        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Every culture has some form of fermented vegetable, and this is
          Norway’s. Tender cabbage pieces are soaked in vinegar and butter with
          caraway and apple pieces. The result is sauerkraut that has a slightly
          sweet flavor. This is the perfect side on any cold plate or palette
          refresher in between courses. If sauerkraut is too strong for you, try
          surkal. Its simple ingredients soften the flavor and may be just what
          your taste buds need to enjoy pickled cabbage.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>26 ounces cabbage</li>
          <li>2 apples, cored</li>
          <li>2 1/2 ounces butter</li>
          <li>2 cups distilled white vinegar</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 tablespoon caraway</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Shred the cabbage using the slicing disc of a food processor, then
            switch to the shredding disk to shred the apple (it's okay to leave
            the skin on).
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt butter in a large, heavy pot, then add remaining ingredients
            (except parsley) and bring to a simmer. Cook over low heat, stirring
            occasionally, for about 90 minutes, until the cabbage is soft and
            has darkened and the vinegar has reduced and softened in flavor. You
            may need to increase the heat near the end to finish reducing the
            vinegar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from the heat and, as Grandma Agny indicated, "Serve in a
            nice-looking dish; garnish with apple wedges and parsley."
